Welcome to my pathetic GitHub profile!

I'm **Julien Saab**, I work as a team lead for various RFID related projects, and I'm a part-time instructor at the American University of Science and Technology, Lebanon. In my free time (if any), I like to learn about new technologies, create some projects that I think are interesting and/or beneficial for me or my career, or just go over things I already know to implement solutions from a new perspective.

Here you'll find a variety of projects, most of which aren't really that special and sometimes are too specific. Hopefully, in the near future, I'll migrate my private repositories to here and make them public.

One thing that might have caught your attention is the fact that I heavily use Java as my language of choice. This is due to two things:
1. Java is a statically typed language. Which in my opinion makes large scale projects more maintainable.
2. Community. Java has a large community behind it with a lot of libraries and tools that reduce development time.

However, I do enjoy developing in other languages also, but this depends on the requirements and needs.
